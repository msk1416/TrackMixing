# TrackMixing
Android application to convert any YouTube song into separate instrumental tracks

The application is my first attempt at MVC architecture after completing an Udemy course about how to apply MVC architecture on Android.

By now it runs on local server as there is no intention on publishing it to Play Store (AWS is not free or cheap, of course, after the free-tier).

The server implementation (Node.js) can be found in a separate [repository](https://github.com/msk1416/demucser).
